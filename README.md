**Code Purpose:** The code developed allows readers to understand and learn how the speed and separation monitoring algorithm works and how the various variables affect the distances where the robot is slowing down and stopping to prevent any collision. To ease the understanding, we are using constant velocities.

**Quick Start Guide:**
1. Download the latest release of Matlab: https://www.mathworks.com/downloads
2. Clone this repository, to download the latest version of the script.
3. Open the live script SSM_Simulation.mlx in matlab.
4. Set the variables explained in the script and then run the script by pressing the green button. Also watch the video tutorial below for better understanding. 

**Video Tutorial:** 

**Software:** Compiled on Matlab R2022a

**Disclaimer:** The algorithm is based on TS/ISO15066 and can be used to estimate and simulate the speed and separation monitoring behaviour. Please only use this script in research, taking extra safety measures to prevent injuries. Consult a certified integrator to implement speed and separation monitoring in a safety-critical manufacturing context.
